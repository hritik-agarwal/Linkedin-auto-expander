These are instructions on how to communicate with developer and how to write code.

# Communication guidelines

- Keep your responses short and to the point.
- Clarify when needed, don't perform on assumptions.

# Coding guidelines

Write high-quality, clean, and concise code across projects. Adapt according to project.

- Follow DRY, KISS, and SOC principle.
- Use function-based architecture for better organization and maintainability.
- No free strings, use constants/enums even for html ids/classes. Create constants at top of each file where they are used.
- No logs and comments, keep code concise and easy to understand.
- Consistent naming format for nouns, verbs, constants, ids, classes, functions etc.
- Build in smaller chunks, no more than 1 tasks at once.
- Always create/update project.md with completed tasks and next steps after each task completion.
- Do not output or describe what changes were made or what you did after completing tasks, just say done.
- Write robust, event-driven solutions instead of quick fixes that break across different network conditions and user environments.
- NEVER add extra features, functionality beyond what is explicitly asked for. If you think additional features would be helpful, ask the user first before implementing anything.
